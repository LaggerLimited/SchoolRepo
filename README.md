# 2D Tank Sim

2D Tank Sim is a python game in development by a group of University of Toledo students. It includes 2 tank objects that represent each player, and a Move() algorithm.

## Running the Program

Run by opening a shell and navigating to the directory in which the file is downloaded. Then use the command:

```bash
python 2DTankSim.py
```

## Usage

Currently no input is being read from the user to move the tanks. This will be implemented next.
